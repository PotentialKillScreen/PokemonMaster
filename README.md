# Overview
I have designed a board game I call Pokémon Master.
The repository includes the nanDeck code and links to the spreadsheets that are used to generate cards and tokens for the game.

This includes 
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/Poke%CC%81mon_cards.txt) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPzayRnjuT_c4CYZc-YV7DQSxzZjHgZv37PYPLxd5l4/edit?usp=sharing) for the 78 standard Pokémon cards.
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/attacks.txt) for the attacks. (Uses the same spreadsheet as the Pokémon cards).
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/big_tokens.txt) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p3MUjCsOj9vzwaKHsAiS8_Nvf1794kAyfSJ_X1AKvF0/edit?usp=sharing) for the 2 inch diameter tokens.
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/Med_tokens.txt) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYQsYaBUIJ-i0YxczkGu4YMINQ1VmG1u3ZD3Jd7khNo/edit?usp=sharing) for the 1 inch tokens.
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/Small_tokens.txt) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JbcWSflya8vkWgqC4gYqzpG1nDcXbm768UHIVdckHOg/edit?usp=sharing) for the 2 cm tokens.
- The [code](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/tiny_tokens.txt) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6g_QOdnGkjSQK-6V_sZqOfjRwdSS3VUILW1QCmygGg/edit?usp=sharing) for the 0.5 inch tokens.


Also included are images of the final product, including the board, cards, tokens and other miscellaneous stuff.

Finally the current version of the [rulebook](https://github.com/PotentialKillScreen/PokemonMaster/blob/main/Rules.pdf) is included, though it is written for the creator and not pedagogical enough to teach effiencently teach the game to a beginner.

### Method
I have used the program nanDeck to automate the creation of the cards and the tokens of the game. This means that instead of making an image for each card and token I instead write code
for each deck. The code references a spreadsheet where each row represents a single card. This enables me to leverage the logic in the nanDeck language as well as the Excel Formula Language and VBA.
Nandeck uses images that are saved locally. I have not included the images and symbols that are required to reproduce the game. Producing the current version of the game has taken about 300 hours of work.
This includes creating an earlier version and playtesting it with friends.

### Discussion
My vision for the game was to create an advanced board game with the theme of Pokémon.
The Pokémon Company's products are mostly aimed at children which I believe is a shame since a big portion of the kids that grew up with Pokémon are now grown up.

I am quite happy with the final product and my friends seem to like the game slighly more than the average game I own. I would make the following points when comparing the game with top ranked games on gameboardgeek.
- Pokémon Master is more unwieldly. It works well when I am present but I can imagine that playing the game without an expert could be challenging.
- The game is more thematic and the theme is greatly appreciated.
- The strategic decisions are about as interesting.

I don't own the IP and I don't have ambitions to get the game published or make money from the product.
